I am a research scientist at the IOCAS. Before I joined the IOCAS in 2012, 
I worked with Dr. Lee-Lueng Fu at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the 
California Institute of Technology. My academic background includes a Ph.D. 
in Physical Oceanography, a M.S. in Physics (Optics) and an A.S. in Electrical 
Engineering. The diverse background and research experience have nourished my 
ability to seek answers for questions in a broad, general, flexible "roadmap". 
My research interests include understanding how ocean system works and its 
relationship to climate variability, using in-situ, satellite observations 
and numerical experiments. Some of my findings benefited from novel 
applications of statistical methods for signal detection .
